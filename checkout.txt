To go back to any of the  previous commit :

git checkout "commit ID" 

Commit ID can be find by using following command :

git log


Also Another way is to delete the recent commits

To do so :

git reset --hard "Commit ID you want to go"


********************************************


After pushing to main repo , if we want to get back to previous commit both logal and remote

Use this :

git revert "current commit ID" "commit ID we want to go back"

press ENTER

A new text file will open, just quit

NOTE: if you go back N commits , N text files will get open

Just use :

git push
